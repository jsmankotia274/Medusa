      <h2>Strategies</h2>
      <h3>Uses</h3>

         <li>Medusa's main use is instantly killing a potentially dangerous unit with its main ability, Petrify (with the exception of Enslaved Giants, Giants, other Medusas,Speartons in Shield Wall, Charrog, and Treature even then are severely damaged).</li>
         <li>It can also use Venom Flux as a deterrent to any attack, as it will poison units.</li>
         <li>Venom Flux is usually used in order to give Medusa more space between enemies.</li>
         <li>It is also effective at taking on weak ranged units (note that this spell can hit air units). Although units can still get past, it can weaken mass rushes.</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>The mythological Medusa petrifies any person that looks upon her, slightly different than in Stick Empires, where Medusa stares at a person to petrify them.</li>
         <li>As there is only one Medusa in mythology, the unit in Stick Empires should technically be called gorgons.</li>
         <li>Medusa used to cost 500 mana, until they were buffed by reducing their cost to 400 mana.</li>
         <li>Medusa is the fastest spell casting unit in the game (Her spells have only little delay to cast and activate).</li>
         <li>The image for the spell petrify shows a half-petrified miner.</li>
         <li>A Medusa can petrify another Medusa. However, it requires 2 Medusas to petrify an enemy Medusa, because petrify only removes half the health of a Medusa. (2 bars out of 4).</li>
      </ul>
